    <div class="intro-content">
        I am a final-year MSc student in <a href="https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/bnzu/lidx/1">Simulation Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.rwth-aachen.de/">RWTH Aachen</a>. Growing up thinking how the world is one big simulation, I am fortunate to study and work towards this line of thought.
        <br><br>
        At <a href="https://www.cmm.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/gaot/?lidx=1">Chair for Material Mechanics</a> in RWTH, my current work focuses on solving equations of mechanical equilibrium in material microstructures using CNNs and operator-based learning. 
        <br><br>
        My interests lie in the confluence of machine learning, applied maths and physics. Isn't it amazing how so much around us can be modelled as partial differential equations, be it material microstructures or oceanic flows! But solving these PDEs for huge and highly resolved systems in feasible time is a significant challenge. I aspire to contribute towards the development of data-driven learning-based approaches to approximate solutions, where speedups can reach >1000 times compared to numerical solvers! 
        <br><br>
        I completed my BTech in Materials Engineering with Gold medal from <a href="https://www.nitw.ac.in">NIT Warangal</a> in India. During this time, I spent a summer abroad in Montreal, Canada, at <a href="https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/research/professors/videmers/">Prof. Vincent Demers'</a> lab, as a <a href="https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink">MITACS</a> scholar in the field of process modelling. I spent another summer at <a href="https://www.iitrpr.ac.in/smmee/dhiraj">Prof. Dhiraj Mahajan's</a> lab in <a href="https://www.iitrpr.ac.in">IIT Ropar</a>, where I worked in design and development of self-healing polymers.
