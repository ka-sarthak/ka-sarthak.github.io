\begin{rSection}{Work Experience}
{\bf Wissenschaftliche Hilfskraft (Research Assistant)} \hfill {\em 2021.05 - Present}\\
{\em Chair for Material Mechanics, RWTH Aachen}\\
As a research assistant under Prof. Bob Svendsen, I am developing learning-based approaches to infer solutions of differential equations involved in solid mechanics, thereby providing an alternative to expensive numerical solvers. Working extensively with Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch.

{\bf Application Development Analyst} \hfill {\em 2020.09 - 2020.12}\\

\begin{rSection}{Projects}
{\bf Detecting gravity waves in atmospheric temperature data} \hfill {\em2022.06}\\
{\em Applied and Computational Mathematics, RWTH Aachen}\\
As part of a week-long study excursion, we developed an algorithm to detect gravity wave events, which are essential for reliable weather predictions, in large datasets of atmospheric temperature. The project was supervised by Dr. Joern Ungermann from Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich and the code was written in Python using NumPy, SciPy, JAX libraries.

{\bf Tracking local optima in dynamic systems}\hfill {\em 2021.10 - 2022.02}\\
{\em Software and Tools for Computational Engineering, RWTH Aachen}\\
Supervised by Prof. Uwe Naumann from Informatik-12, this semester-long project focused on building local-optima-tracking software for dynamic time-dependent functions. The software was written in C++ using dco/c++ library for automatic differentiation. 

{\bf Fast iterative solvers for linear systems}\hfill {\em 2021.04 - 2021.09}\\
{\em Aachen Institute for Advanced Study in Computational Engineering Science, RWTH Aachen}\\
Programmed multigrid solvers, Krylov-based linear system solvers (GMRES and CG) and eigensolver algorithms (Lanczos and Power Iteration) for huge sparse matrices taken from MatrixMarket. These implementations used vanilla Python code without computational libraries.

{\bf Simulation of Mold Filling in LPIM (MITACS Scholar)} \hfill {\em 2019.05 - 2019.08}\\
{\em Ecole Technologie Superieure, Montreal}\\
As a summer research intern, I worked on optimizing LPIM injection stage for metallic feedstock using FEM simulations and experimentation. I also worked on an initial layout of a new viscosity model that accurately captured viscosity behavior for our application. Gained experience in Moldflow, AutoCAD, MATLAB, and feedstock preparation.

{\bf Phase Field Modeling of Ternary System} \hfill {\em 2018.11 - 2019.04}\\
{\em National Institute of Technology, Warangal}\\
During this semester-long bachelor project, I built a simulation routine to study the growth kinetics of precipitates in a hypothetical ternary alloy system. It was based on a phase-field model with semi-implicit spectral formulation and written in C using FFT libraries.
